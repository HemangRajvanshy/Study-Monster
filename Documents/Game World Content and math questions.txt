Math book and misc. content:

First Village: Basic Math.

Overview:
	Topics to be taught: Basic trigonometry, solving and intuition for quadractics and relation between 	the graphical and analytical representation of equations and functions.

Teaching Material:

	Baisc Trigonometry:
	(Only with a triangle and for acute angles)
	https://www.mathsisfun.com/algebra/trigonometry.html
	
	Graphs, functions and equations:
	Starting with the example of a straight line equation, demonstrate its graph, its features and how 	the graph is related to the equation. Now with a quadratic, do the same, this time, also tell them 	about a function. (An equation is like a machine, for every x, it'd give you one or more y, a 	function on the otherhand will always give you a single y)
	Develop a feeling for solution of quadratics here, and also for solutions of more than one simultaneous equation.
	

	
Second Village: Conic Sections.

Overview: 
	Topics covered: circles, parabolas, ellipses and hyperbolas.
	
Teaching Material:
	Tell the student how the graphs of equations can be used to describe to crazy shapes with very specific properties. Also, can tell them about the applications of parabola and ellipses in mirrors
